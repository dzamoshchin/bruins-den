        //keys and put them in the 'keys' array above, well if I did 'for key in keys{}' outside of the method call to get thte keys 'keys' would be
        //empty when the for loop looks at it. So to make sure that that does not happen, we had to put everything using that data
        //inside the method that gets that data, and since the data we need is three levels deep (department>teacher>teacher-info) there
        //is another 'observeSingleEvent' call each within the previous level (for a grand total of three calls alltogether). There are also
        //two if statements all the way in the teacher information call to check if all the departments and teachers have been created.
