        //used to take data from the database) is tricky to explain. You get the data through one of the parameters (weird right?)
        //and for some reason swift likes to split things up and everything outside of the method 'observeSingleEvent' will be finished
        //before everything inside, meaning everything inside will be gotten too late if it is used outside. Example: I want to get all of the department
        //keys and put them in the 'keys' array above, well if I did 'for key in keys{}' outside of the method call to get thte keys 'keys' would be 
        //empty when the for loop looks at it. So to make sure that that does not happen, we had to put everything using that data
        //inside the method that gets that data, and since the data we need is three levels deep (department>teacher>teacher-info) there
        //is another 'observeSingleEvent' call each within the previous level (for a grand total of three calls alltogether). There are also 
        //two if statements all the way in the teacher information call to check if all the departments and teachers have been created.
        //Also it is probably good to mention that data taken from the database is most easily casted into a dictionary which is why we do
        //that for every level of data we look at.
